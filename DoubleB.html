<p><strong>DoubleB is the main mainstream specialty coffee chain. Definitly try the author&#8217;s drinks, as well as the Coconut-Almond Flat White</strong></p>

<p>They&#8217;re conveniently located on every somewhat popular metro station and serve consistently well-made drinks. The prices are higher than other specialty coffee shops, but it&#8217;s manageable. </p>

<h3>Espresso Review</h3>

<p><em>As usual, i must note that espresso flavor very much depends on the beans used, and they change from day-to-day</em></p>

<p>DoubleB serves a rare espresso for moscow- every blend is quite sour, fruity, and with a barely-noticeable aftertaste of cigarettes, as one of my friends noted. It is immaculately pressed. Eight out of ten stars.</p>

<h3>To Try</h3>

<ul>
<li>Flat White</li>
<li>Espresso</li>
</ul>

<h3>Insider Tips</h3>

<p>On weekdays from eight to eleven o&#8217;clock each morning, all black coffees cost only a hundred roubles, which, at the time of this writing, is only one and a half euros- less than Milan.</p>
