<h1>Why do we dream of owning various objects?</h1>

<p>Ah, objects. From the very first moment one understands about the world to think, one is asked to pick a toy for one&#8217;s birthday, as a gift. This leaves a mark on our mind- our brains are wired to consume.</p>

<p>As we get older, our wants change. Sally may want a computer while Bob may desire a makeup kit from MAC. No well-to-do company sells just an object or product- everyone sells a lifestyle. Buy a Thinkpad- you will become a great businessman! Buy a Tom Ford Jacket- you will be the soul of a party! </p>

<p>One is in need for such idealistic lifestyles because no thinking creature is happy with their current life, and everyone wants to change something about it. This is where marketers come in and sell us goods we do not need.</p>

<h2>When one dreams about an object, one associates it with a lifestyle straight away, and yearns not for the object, but for the lifestyle it is thought to provide.</h2>

<p><strong>So, to TL; DR:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>objects represent lifestyles</li>
<li>we are unhappy with our current, real life</li>
<li>we get a certain satisfaction when we dream</li>
</ul>
