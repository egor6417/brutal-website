	<h1>A Sunday in Moscow</h1>
	<p>I wake up, drink a glass of water and put on my clothes. I leave the house and walk to the train station. </p>

	<p>I take the train to tushino and the subway to pushkinskaya. Then, I lazily and slowly walk to davidb cafe, a muscovite icon, while taking pictures and philosophizing.</p>
	<p>The baristas already know my order- a double espresso macchiato and a random croissant. The cafe serves the best croissants i have ever had, not only in moscow but anywhere in the world.</p>
	<p>I open the latest new york times issue on my ipad and savour the espresso. After the newspaper is finished, i open a book i am currently reading and read a chapter while indulging in the croissant. After that, i leave the cafe. </p>
	<p>I walk around the patriarch ponds neighborhood absent mindedly, thinking all the time. Maybe i will wander into a store- who knows? </p>
	<p> If my bank account allows for it, i walk to my favourite flower store and buy a bouquet- i do not yet know who i will gift it to, but flowers are always good. </p>
	<p> I meet up with a friend, and we walk, talking about subjects ranging from politics to philosophy to opinions on which ice cream is tastier. </p>
	<p> This is how i spend eighty per cent of my sundays, the only free days in my life. </p>
