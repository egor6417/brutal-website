<h2>On Depression.</h2>

<p>We, humans, as a species have a long history with depression, and for each of us the reasons are personal. Some can not even put a finger on it- maybe they are ruled by their hormones and will soon get over it- who knows?</p>

<p>I am definitely not enough of a medic to answer the question why humans are so overruled by depression, but i have suffered enough and thought about it enough that i dare say i am able to answer the question in the philosophical aspect.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Examples of famous humans who suffered from depression</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>cara delevigne</li>
<li>sergei esenin</li>
<li>agatha christie</li>
<li>ellen degeneres</li>
<li>truman capote</li>
<li>fyodor dostoevsky (accidentally my favourite russian writer)</li>
<li>marilyn monroe</li>
<li>f. scott fitzgerald (also accidentally my favourite English writer bar hemingway)</li>
<li><p>to name just a few&#8230;</p>
Basically, seventy percent of people admit to having had depression, and the others do not but still had it nevertheless.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>We as humans come down to one thing we are ruled by- the desire to be great. For most people in this materialistic world, this means changing their lifestyle. One has a dream idea of the world one desires to live in- and seeing others already achieving this world knocks them down into depression once more.</p>

<p>Some people on the planet are just very sensitive, and any one comment may give them anxiety, and crippling depression for more than a week (yeah, that&#8217;s me). </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>An important thing many developed countries have now realized- <em>mental health is at times more important than its physical counterpart.</em></strong></p>

<p>Let us start from afar- i live in russia, which is by all sane means a developing country. People mind their own business here (since the nineties, when the country was overruled by mafia and one crises after the other), and it is hard to talk to anybody except your closest friends. However, the millennial generation finds it hard to establish close relationships, and many cannot confide in anyone.</p>

<p>I am privileged to have been taught the value of close relationships by my fabulous mother since a very young age, and i have at least one close friend i can confide in at any given time. But, as i mentioned, not many are as privileged in this sense as i am, and the hotlines here are practically non-existent. No wonder the teenage suicide rate in russia is off-the-charts.</p>
