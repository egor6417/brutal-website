<h1>I visited St. Petersburg, Russia.</h1>

<h2>A week ago, I visited Saint Pete. In this post, I would love to share my experience.</h2>

<h3>Cafes and Coffeeshops</h3>

<p>I have outlined three best cafes in the city of Saint Pete- Brother, Civil and Mad Espresso Team, or MET. In this paragraph, I will outline their pros and cons. </p>

<h5>Brother, or БРАТ</h5>

<p>This is clearly a family-owned cafe- one feels like he is a guest at his brother&#8217;s home. The coffee could be rated as a strong nine out of ten, and the menu offers food, wine and breakfasts, as is the usual with Saint Pete.</p>

<h5>Civil</h5>

<p>Civil is a network of coffeshops throughout St. Petersburg; it serves both coffee and wine, although the wine menus are not as plentiful as the ones at Brother. What it lacks in wine it more than maskes up for in Syrniki- traditional Russian curd cakes. They are very tasty, and are certainly the best in Saint Pete. </p>

<h5>Mad Espresso Team (MET)</h5>

<p>The MET serves hands-down the best coffee in the city; I would even go as far as to say it is the best I&#8217;ve ever tasted- whether that is in Moscow, London, or Saint Petersburg. </p>

<h3>Climate</h3>

<p>Because St. Petersburg is located very close to the sea and based on multiple rivers, the climate is wet- expect rainfalls at least once a day- and very cold, as it is located in the very north of Russia. Pack a coat!</p>

<h3>Style</h3>

<p>I was really fascinated with the style of both St. Petersburg men and St. Petersburg women. Most men noticeably care for themselves- with my trained eye, I saw groomed brows, fresh haircuts and impeccable skin, gently topped with a dash of concealer. Women take their inspiration from Paris- berets and trench coats are all the rage in early October. Parisian makeup (minimal foundation, skincare and lipstick) is very popular.</p>

<p>Saint Petersburg has a bunch of designer department stores, from the popular and classic DLT to the more interesting Au Pont Rouge. </p>

<ul>
<li>DLT is the same department store one is used to, with Chanel, Hermes, and Burberry stores. It&#8217;s really quite boring.</li>
<li>A little more interesting is Babochka- it sells OFF-WHITE, Gucci and Ermengildo Zegna (a strange selection, eh?), but in a more concept-store fashion, with a focus on ready-to-wear pieces. It is a pleasure to shop there, although the choice is quite scant.</li>
<li>Au Pont Rouge is the most interesting of them all- it shows off up-and-coming designers, as well as russian ones. If I had to shop at only one store in St. Pete and one in Moscow, I would pick Au Pont Rouge in Petersburg and Stoleshnikov pereulok in Moscow.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Postscriptum.</h2>

<p>Saint Petersburg is the only city I have really ever fallen in love with- this is a tough sentence for me to write, but it&#8217;s true; London is awesome and very easy to live in, but it&#8217;s way too pretentious. Other cities just do not do it for me. St. Petersburg brings out the best in people; it allows one to bring out one&#8217;s humane side and not care about being quote on quote &#8220;better&#8221; than the rest; people just live in St. Pete, they meet up with their friends after work, have a cigarette (as is the custom in Petersburg), and talk about Yesenin&#8217;s death, not once mentioning work. This is just something to think about if you, the reader, live in a big city like Moscow or London- <em>do you ever spend quality time talking with your friends?</em></p>
