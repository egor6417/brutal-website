* Although not the first humans, Homo sapiens came to replace all other human species on Earth
* Humans first appeared about 2.5 million years ago in East Africa, evolving from a genus of great apes known as Australopithecus. These early humans, such as Homo rudolfensis and Homo erectus, eventually migrated, abandoning East Africa for more promising environments. Adaptation to these new habitats led them to evolve into even more forms of Homo, including Homo neanderthalensis in Europe and Asia.
* There are two theories to explain this: The Interbreeding Theory suggests that Homo sapiens began mating with the other species of humans – most notably Homo neanderthalensis – and that that resulted in the species’ gradually merging together. There is evidence to back this theory up: the DNA of modern Europeans contains between 1 and 4 percent of Neanderthal DNA, as well as some DNA from other earlier human species.
* The Replacement Theory, on the other hand, suggests that Homo sapiens, thanks to their slightly superior skills and technology, pushed other human species toward extinction – either by taking away their food sources or by violently killing them off.
* Cognitive Revolution- sapiens start to think and talk, bigger brains
* Imaginative worlds like companies and countries 
* During the Agricultural Revolution, humans transformed from foragers into farmers, which led to exponential population growth.
* , agriculture had one big advantage: it was far more efficient. On just a small patch of land, farmers could grow a mass of edible plants. This increase in the food supply meant that human societies could sustain much higher populations. And thus, the Homo sapiens population exploded.
* Scientific Revolution- new tech and imperialism, economic growth and globalization 
* Today’s global society, with its central belief in the power of capitalism, is a legacy of European imperialism.
* Humankind has never been more peaceful than in our globalized times. 
* In the future, Homo sapiens will transcend biological limits, eventually replacing itself with an entire new species.
