<h1>At the Existentialist Cafe by Sarah Bakewell</h1>
* Existentialists concern themselves with individual, concrete, human existence 
* I am repsonsible for everything i do, and this may cause and anxiety, but that anxiety is inseparate from being
* One is never content; one always wants more 
* Phenomenology concerns itself with phenomena itself
* If one describes experience, one hopes to understand said experience, which will open one's eyes to ways of living more authentic lives.
