* The Universe was created by chance.
* Luck is not real. If we think we are lucky, we are lucky, if not, we are not.
* RoShamBo- if in doubt, throw paper, start with scissors against an experienced player and with paper against a newbie. Every couple of moves make random (game theory), and look for the other person's patterns.
* Blackjack- card counting
* Roulette-
* Lottery- don't pick random numbers- pick numbers over 31, as people usually pick their date of birth and you would have to share.
* Bookmakers- for example, one bookmaker has odds 3 to 1 to win on Cambridge, and 1 to 4 to win on Oxford. The other has 1 to 2 Oxford and 1 to 1 Cambridge. You can place £37.50 on Cambridge with bookie 1 and £100 Oxford with bookie 2, and won £12.50 whatever the outcome
